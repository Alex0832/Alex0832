- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Alex0832. I've been coding in Delphi (older versions 5 and 10) for decades. I tend to work a lot with images and image manipulation. Now and then I write my own helper programs to assist in other programs. As an example, I didn't like having to use websites to create HEX arrays for OLED displays when working with Arduino. So I wrote my own OLED BMP converter for this purpose. It's a simple program, runs locally, and has very small footprint.
- I have several such helper programs that I intend to publish here on GH. Since this is a new experience for me (publishing software on GH), I know that I'm taking the first small steps of many to come.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... I will do more research before publishing my email address...not sure if it will stay private to GH members.
